Financial plan
Summary
The following sheets contain the financial plan of an online coworking space rental platform, the Online platform. Disclaimer: Some of the numbers are made on purpose. The aim of this plan is to show my abilities of building the logic and the structure of a financial plan. 
Via the platform, different types of tickets and passes shall be made available for purchase, which mainly serve the purpose of providing access to coworking spacesâ€™ services. By default, four main types of tickets/passes shall be made available for purchase on the platform: hourly, daily, weekly and monthly. Out of which monthly passes are to be made available in 3 subtypes: hot desk, dedicated desk and private office.
Of all ticket/pass purchase transactions to be completed via the platform, a commission fee shall be deducted. All plans provide free listing on the site, although the rate of commission is depending on the plan. These plans provide featured position in search results, extended customer support, marketing/PR support and detailed analytics for the purchasing offices.
Regarding expenses, the largest amount is to be spent on marketing activities, mainly in forms of social media marketing and search engine marketing. To be able to support the increased human resource necessary to grow, the second largest amount is to be spent on payroll expenses.
